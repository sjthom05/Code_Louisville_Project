Code Louisville Capstone Project

My Code Louisville FSJS project is a recipe list app. This app allows you to 
view a list of recipes from the database, create new recipes that are added 
to the list, and delete recipes when you are done with them

How to start my application

1. Clone git respository
2. Navagate to the directory
3. Run `npm install`
4. Start mongo
    * If you dono't have mongo installed here is a link to an install guide here https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/?jmp=foote
5. Run `node src/app.js`
6. Navigate to localhost:3000/
